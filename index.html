					<h2>Biography</h2>
					<p>I am computer science student at Georgia State University. My interest in software development began when I was in high school exploring app development, web design, video game code and other technology. 
					Since then I've been building the skills to turn my dreams into usable technology. My goal has always been to make my dreams as close to reality as I possibly could. Along with technology my 2 other biggest passions are video games and sports. 
					My life is essentially a revolving door of technology, sports, and video games. I play so much video games that I decided to make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuILcU-w7rEeQrgCHnDKNlA">youtube channel </a> as well as a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bokiiitv">twitch channel </a> to see where I could take gaming. 
					And for sports I am always watching <a href="https://scoopempire.com/10-reasons-why-soccer-is-the-best-sport-in-the-world/#:~:text=Soccer%20has%20Fluid%20Play&text=That%20is%20one%20reason%20why,in%20motion%20at%20all%20times.">sports </a> or playing sports. 
					I play basketball twice a week, I play soccer once a week and when the weather is warm I also play volleyball and football once a week.</p>
